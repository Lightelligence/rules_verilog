# Verilog rules for Bazel

## Setup
                                                                                                  
Add the following to your `WORKSPACE` file:

```skylark
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
http_archive(                                                                                                                                                                            
    name = "rules_verilog",
    urls = ["https://github.com/Lightelligence/rules_verilog/archive/v0.0.0.tar.gz"],
    sha256 = "ab64a872410d22accb383c7ffc6d42e90f4de40a7cd92f43f4c26471c4f14908",
    strip_prefix = "rules_verilog-0.0.0",
)
load("@rules_verilog//:deps.bzl", "verilog_dependencies")
verilog_dependencies()
```
**Note**: Update commit and sha256 as needed.


Cadence Xcelium needs both HOME and LM_LICENESE_FILE environment variables, add them to your `.bazelrc` file:

```
test --action_env=HOME
test --action_env=LM_LICENSE_FILE
```

### Python Dependencies
rules_verilog is also dependent on several python libraries. These are defined in requirements.txt and maybe installed in the package manager of your choice. The recommended flow is to install them via the pip_install rule in your `WORKSPACE` file:

```skylark
load("@rules_python//python:pip.bzl", "pip_install")

pip_install(
    name = "pip_deps",
    requirements = "@rules_verilog//:requirements.txt",
)
```

## Rules

### RTL
Load rules into your `BUILD` files from [@rules_verilog//verilog:defs.bzl](verilog/defs.bzl)

- [verilog_rtl_library](docs/defs.md#verilog_rtl_library)
- [verilog_rtl_pkg](docs/defs.md#verilog_rtl_pkg)
- [verilog_rtl_shell](docs/defs.md#verilog_rtl_shell)
- [verilog_rtl_unit_test](docs/defs.md#verilog_rtl_unit_test)
- [verilog_rtl_lint_test](docs/defs.md#verilog_rtl_lint_test)
- [verilog_rtl_cdc_test](docs/defs.md#verilog_rtl_cdc_test)


### DV
Load rules into your `BUILD` files from [@rules_verilog//verilog:defs.bzl](verilog/defs.bzl)

- [verilog_dv_library](docs/defs.md#verilog_dv_library)
- [verilog_dv_unit_test](docs/defs.md#verilog_dv_unit_test)
- [verilog_dv_tb](docs/defs.md#verilog_dv_tb)
- [verilog_dv_test_cfg](docs/defs.md#verilog_dv_test_cfg)


### Generic Verilog
Load rules into your `BUILD` files from [@rules_verilog//verilog:defs.bzl](verilog/defs.bzl)

- [verilog_test](docs/defs.md#verilog_test)

## Caveats

### Vendor Support
These rules were written with the Cadence and Synopsys tools as the underlying compiler and simulator. Abstraction leaks are prevalent throughout the rules.

### UVM Testbenches
While rules for unit tests exist, the [verilog_dv_tb](docs/defs.md#verilog_dv_tb) and [verilog_dv_test_cfg](docs/defs.md#verilog_dv_test_cfg) rules are intended to work in conjunction with an external script capable of spawning many parallel simulations. Documentation throughout this codebase refers to a tool called `simmer` which may be released in a future version.
